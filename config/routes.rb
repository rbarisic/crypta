  # The priority is based upon order of creation: first created -> highest priority.
  # See how all your routes lay out with "rake routes".

  # You can have the root of your site routed with "root"
  # root 'welcome#index'

  # Example of regular route:
  #   get 'products/:id' => 'catalog#view'

  # Example of named route that can be invoked with purchase_url(id: product.id)
  #   get 'products/:id/purchase' => 'catalog#purchase', as: :purchase

  # Example resource route (maps HTTP verbs to controller actions automatically):
  #   resources :products

  # Example resource route with options:
  #   resources :products do
  #     member do
  #       get 'short'
  #       post 'toggle'
  #     end
  #
  #     collection do
  #       get 'sold'
  #     end
  #   end

  # Example resource route with sub-resources:
  #   resources :products do
  #     resources :comments, :sales
  #     resource :seller
  #   end

  # Example resource route with more complex sub-resources:
  #   resources :products do
  #     resources :comments
  #     resources :sales do
  #       get 'recent', on: :collection
  #     end
  #   end

  # Example resource route with concerns:
  #   concern :toggleable do
  #     post 'toggle'
  #   end
  #   resources :posts, concerns: :toggleable
  #   resources :photos, concerns: :toggleable

  # Example resource route within a namespace:
  #   namespace :admin do
  #     # Directs /admin/products/* to Admin::ProductsController
  #     # (app/controllers/admin/products_controller.rb)
  #     resources :products
  #   end
end


# ===============================================================================

# Some setup you must do manually if you haven't yet:

#   1. Ensure you have defined default url options in your environments files. Here
#      is an example of default_url_options appropriate for a development environment
#      in config/environments/development.rb:

#        config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { host: 'localhost', port: 3000 }

#      In production, :host should be set to the actual host of your application.

#   2. Ensure you have defined root_url to *something* in your config/routes.rb.
#      For example:

#        root to: "home#index"

#   3. Ensure you have flash messages in app/views/layouts/application.html.erb.
#      For example:

#        <p class="notice"><%= notice %></p>
#        <p class="alert"><%= alert %></p>

#   4. If you are deploying on Heroku with Rails 3.2 only, you may want to set:

#        config.assets.initialize_on_precompile = false

#      On config/application.rb forcing your application to not access the DB
#      or load models when precompiling your assets.

#   5. You can copy Devise views (for customization) to your app by running:

#        rails g devise:views
